# Lack of `newAddress` Validation in `setValidatorAddress`

krkba
## Summary
There is no validation if `newAddress` in `setValidatorAddress` is a contract address. 
## Vulnerability Detail
If a contract address is provided and it doesn't have a necessary function to receive tokens, tokens could be locked in the contract forever.
## Impact
Loss of funds.
