# Unstaking limit issue

## Summary

When change validator address, we can't move over 300 unstakings to new address. But when stake/unstake, we can push new staking/unstaking endless. And after transferUnstakedOut, and then we can set amount to 0, but it is counting to move unstakings.

## Vulnerability Detail

setValidatorAddress function can't move unstakings over 300.

But length of unstakings includes amount 0 unstaking also. need to check unstaking amount is 0 or not. 
So only unempty 300 stakings can move. We need to avoid empty unstakings.

## Impact

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L569-L571

when transferUnstakedOut, currently set amount to 0. so it can be counted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Need to add process to check unempty unstaking or delete empty unstaking after takeout.
