# OperationalStaking::setValidatorAddress Validator can bypass validatorMaxStake threshold by setting address to an existing delegator

## Summary
A maximum limitation is checked to ensure that a validator does not stake a too big amount, unfortunately this limitation can be bypassed by setting a new validator address

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see that during a call to `setValidatorAddress` the existing stake for a validator is transferred to the new address:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L696-L697 

And the stake amount is not checked against `validatorMaxStake` as done during _stake:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L429

This means that a validator can use delegation from another address to bypass the `validatorMaxStake` limitation

## Impact
A validator can stake more than `validatorMaxStake` bypassing the security check introduced by the protocol

## Recommendation
Ensure the check is called during `setValidatorAddress` as well:

```diff
+ require(v.stakings[newAddress].staked <= validatorMaxStake, "Validator max stake exceeded");
```
