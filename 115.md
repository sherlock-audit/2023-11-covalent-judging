# ContributorsN will fail against _BlockSpecimenQuorum even though it is met

## Summary
in `BlockSpecimenProofChain` `contributorsN` is checked against `_BlockSpecimenQuorum` however it should pass when it meets the quorum, but instead it fails if `contributorsN` = `_BlockSpecimenQuorum`
## Vulnerability Detail
This happens because of the error the team made, by using `>` instead of `>=`
## Impact
This will eventually lead to the check failing while it should instead pass, for instance if the quorum would be set to 50% which is reasonable and logical, if the contributors would match this percentage it would still not pass due to the lack of the `=` sign. Usually this small mistake would be seen as a low, but in this scenario I would deem it to be medium because the quorum is intent to be set to a logical percentage which could very well be equally met by the contributorsN and should therefore be able to be passed.

```diff
+ if (_minSubmissionsRequired <= max && (max * _DIVIDER) / contributorsN >= _blockSpecimenQuorum)
```
