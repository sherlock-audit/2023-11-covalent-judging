# A delegator can receive the rewards immediately by calling `stake` or `redelegateUnstake` to corresponding delegator when `RewardFailedDueLowPool` event emitted.

## Summary
If `rewardPool` does not have enough values to reward the validators, `exchangeRate` will not be updated at that moment and will be updated after calling `rewardValidators` again.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `stakingManager` calls `rewardValidators` function, if there is not enough `rewardPool` to distribute rewards to `validators`, the `RewardFailedDueLowPool` event will be emitted and the validator's `exchangeRate` will not be updated.
Even though delegator has not yet delegated staking to the validator, delegator can receive the rewards by calling `stake` or `redelegateUnstake` if `stakingManager` calls `depositRewardTokens` and then `rewardValidators` again later.

## Impact
By hooking event emitting, can receive the reward by staking immediately. 
An malicious delegator can receive rewards immediately knowing that the rewards will be distributed to specific validators shortly thereafter.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`stakingManager` must check if rewardPool is enough to reward to `validators`.
If it is not enough, then it should be reverted instead of emitting event.
