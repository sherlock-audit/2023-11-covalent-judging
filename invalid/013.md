# Potential Underflow in recoverUnstaking and transferUnstakedOut Functions

## Summary
The **recoverUnstaking** and **transferUnstakedOut** functions in the contract might be susceptible to underflow issues, leading to unintended consequences like locking funds indefinitely or creating inaccuracies in tracking staked amounts.
## Vulnerability Detail
Both the **recoverUnstaking** and **transferUnstakedOut** functions deduct an amount from **us.amount** without ensuring that **us.amount** is greater than or equal to amount. Solidity 0.8.x does have in-built overflow/underflow protection, but relying solely on this can lead to unexpected contract behavior, like transaction reverts, especially if the logic assumes certain state changes post deduction.
## Impact
If an underflow occurs (although protected by Solidity's in-built mechanism), it may cause transactions to fail or get reverted, leading to a denial of service. It might also cause issues with the correct accounting of staked tokens, potentially leading to locked funds or inaccurate tracking of staked amounts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the amount being deducted is never greater than the available amount to prevent potential underflow, even though Solidity 0.8.x offers inherent protection. Implement checks to validate that **us.amount** is greater than or equal to **amount** before performing the deduction. Here's a modified code snippet to illustrate this:

```solidity
function recoverUnstaking(uint128 amount, uint128 validatorId, uint128 unstakingId) external whenNotPaused {
    //...
    require(us.amount >= amount, "Unstaking amount is insufficient for the requested recovery");
    us.amount -= amount;
    //...
}

function transferUnstakedOut(uint128 amount, uint128 validatorId, uint128 unstakingId) external whenNotPaused {
    //...
    require(us.amount >= amount, "Unstaking amount is insufficient for the requested transfer");
    us.amount -= amount;
    //...
}
```
