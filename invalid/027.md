# When unstaking, length of unstaking increasing. It may cause overflow

## Summary
_unstake() function push always Unstaking(coolDownEnd, effectiveAmount). It is increasing index of array always.
after transferUnstakedOut and then amount is 0, need to replace this one because it's not necessary.

## Vulnerability Detail
_unstake() pushing new Unstaking(coolDownEnd, effectiveAmount) and return unstakingId.

Imagine there are lots of transferUnstakedOut() all amount, so amount = 0 and coolDownEnd = 0, it's useless anymore.

When push new unstaking, need to check empty unstaking item and replace it and return id
