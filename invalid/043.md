# All address can be removed and not the active ones

## Summary
In the current implementation of the removeBSPOperator function, there is a potential vulnerability due to the absence of a check to confirm the existence of the operator before attempting to remove it. This oversight might lead to unintended consequences if a user mistakenly attempts to remove an operator that doesn't exist.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function removeBSPOperator(address operator) external onlyGovernor {
        require(operatorRoles[operator] == BLOCK_SPECIMEN_PRODUCER_ROLE, "Operator is not BSP");
        _removeBSPOperatorFromActiveInstances(operator);
        uint128 validatorID = validatorIDs[operator];
        _validatorOperators[validatorID].remove(operator);
        validatorIDs[operator] = 0;
        operatorRoles[operator] = 0;
        emit OperatorRemoved(operator, validatorID, _validatorActiveOperatorsCounters[validatorID], BLOCK_SPECIMEN_PRODUCER_ROLE);
    }
```
     // Check if the operator has the BLOCK_SPECIMEN_PRODUCER_ROLE
     
      // Remove the operator from active instances
     
      // Get the validatorID associated with the operator
      
      // Remove the operator from the validator's list of operators
      
        // Zero out the validatorID, operatorRoles, and emit the OperatorRemoved event
       
       The vulnerability lies in the aspect when it removeBSPOperator() calls `_removeBSPOperatorFromActiveInstances(operator);`
     
     >here:
     * Disables the operator instance.
     * If all addresses of the operator are disabled, then the operator (validator) instance will get disabled on the staking contract
     
     
```solidity 
        function _removeBSPOperatorFromActiveInstances(address operator) internal {
        _blockSpecimenProducers.remove(operator);
        uint128 validatorId = validatorIDs[operator];
        _validatorActiveOperatorsCounters[validatorId]--;
    }
 ```
 

In the internal function remove an operator from the list  _blockSpecimenProducers.remove(operator); mapping but which doesn't seem to follow what the [inline comment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/218d4a583286fa0d3d4263151a927f6cc9465b62/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L162C1-L166C8) was talking about.

However, the provided code does not include the logic to check whether all addresses of the operator are disabled.
 
 ```solidity
require(operatorRoles[operator] == BLOCK_SPECIMEN_PRODUCER_ROLE, "Operator is not BSP");
```

This statement checks if the specified operator has the role of a Block Specimen Producer (BSP). It verifies that the operator is assigned the expected role in the operatorRoles mapping, which has nothing to do with BSP from the look of things.

An address that has the BLOCK_SPECIMEN_PRODUCER_ROLE can be removed even though they are not active, not sure if is the behavior of the contract.


     
## Impact
The lack of an existence check allows the function to proceed with the removal process even when the specified operator is not found in the active instances.

## Tool used
Critical thinking

## Recommendation
```solidity
require(_blockSpecimenProducers.contains(operator), "Operator not found in active instances");
```

or
     
```solidity 
        function _removeBSPOperatorFromActiveInstances(address operator) internal {
        if (areAllAddressesDisabled(operator)) {
        // Perform additional steps to disable the operator on the staking contract
        disableOperatorOnStakingContract(validatorId);
        _blockSpecimenProducers.remove(operator);
        uint128 validatorId = validatorIDs[operator];
        _validatorActiveOperatorsCounters[validatorId]--;
    }
 ```
 
 Yes


By including this check, the function ensures that the specified operator is part of the active instances before initiating any state changes. This additional validation step enhances the robustness of the function and prevents unintended removals caused by Governor mistakes.
