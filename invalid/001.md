# Lack of Input Validation

## Summary
The contract's functions such as **setQuorumThreshold**, **setNthBlock**, and **setMaxSubmissionsPerBlockHeight** lack proper input validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior or manipulation if malicious values are set by authorized roles.
## Vulnerability Detail
The absence of checks in key configuration functions allows setting parameters without any range or condition checks. For instance, setQuorumThreshold does not restrict the input value, potentially allowing a quorum threshold that is unrealistically high (e.g., above 100%) or zero, which is illogical and can disrupt the consensus mechanism.
## Impact
Inconsistent or extreme configuration values may compromise the contract's integrity, leading to halted operations, or make the contract susceptible to manipulation, jeopardizing the security and intended functionality of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforce stringent input validation by setting permissible ranges or conditions for input parameters. For instance, **setQuorumThreshold** should enforce the quorum to be within logical bounds (0, 100%]:
```solidity
function setQuorumThreshold(uint256 quorum) public onlyGovernor {
    require(quorum > 0 && quorum <= _DIVIDER, "BlockSpecimenProofChain: Invalid quorum threshold");
    _blockSpecimenQuorum = quorum;
    emit SpecimenSessionQuorumChanged(quorum);
}
```
