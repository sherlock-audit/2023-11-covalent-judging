# OperationalStaking.sol :: _stake() employs REWARD_REDEEM_THRESHOLD instead of DEFAULT_DELEGATOR_MIN_STAKE to validate the minimum stake.

## Summary
**`_stake()`** serves the purpose of staking tokens either from delegators to a validator or for a validator to augment their stake position. The issue lies in its utilization of **`REWARD_REDEEM_THRESHOLD`** instead of **`DEFAULT_DELEGATOR_MIN_STAKE`** to validate the minimum stake requirement.
## Vulnerability Detail
**`_stake()`** is used for users to stake tokens:
```Solidity
function _stake(uint128 validatorId, uint128 amount, bool withTransfer) internal {
        require(validatorId < validatorsN, "Invalid validator");
@>      require(amount >= REWARD_REDEEM_THRESHOLD, "Stake amount is too small");
        Validator storage v = _validators[validatorId];
        bool isValidator = msg.sender == v._address;

        require(!v.frozen, "Validator is frozen");

        // validators should be able to stake if they are disabled.
        if (!isValidator) require(v.disabledAtBlock == 0, "Validator is disabled");

        Staking storage s = v.stakings[msg.sender];

        uint128 newStaked = s.staked + amount;

        require(newStaked >= delegatorMinStake, "Cannot stake to a position less than delegatorMinStake");

        uint128 sharesAdd = _tokensToShares(amount, v.exchangeRate);

        if (isValidator) {
            // compares with newStaked to ignore compounded rewards
            require(newStaked <= validatorMaxStake, "Validator max stake exceeded");
        } else {
            // cannot stake more than validator delegation max cap
            uint128 delegationMaxCap = v.stakings[v._address].staked * maxCapMultiplier;
            uint128 newDelegated = v.delegated + amount;
            require(newDelegated <= delegationMaxCap, "Validator max delegation exceeded");
            v.delegated = newDelegated;
        }

        // "buy/mint" shares
        v.totalShares += sharesAdd;
        s.shares += sharesAdd;

        // keep track of staked tokens
        s.staked = newStaked;
        if (withTransfer) _transferToContract(msg.sender, amount);
        emit Staked(validatorId, msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
As evident, the validation process is incorrect as it utilizes **`REWARD_REDEEM_THRESHOLD`** instead of  **`DEFAULT_DELEGATOR_MIN_STAKE`**.
```Solidity
require(amount >= REWARD_REDEEM_THRESHOLD, "Stake amount is too small");
```
How you can see the value of **`EWARD_REDEEM_THRESHOLD`** 1e10 smallets than **`DEFAULT_DELEGATOR_MIN_STAKE`**
```Solidity
uint128 public constant REWARD_REDEEM_THRESHOLD = 10 ** 8; // minimum number of tokens that can be redeemed validator to become / stay enabled
uint128 public constant DEFAULT_DELEGATOR_MIN_STAKE = 10 ** 18; // stake/unstake operations are invalid if they put you below this threshold (except unstaking to 0)
```
## Impact
Users have the ability to stake small amounts, which deviates from the intended behavior of the protocol.
