# Gas Consumption  in Specimen Finalization Process

## Summary
 The attempt to finalize the session encounters gas consumption issues, leading to transaction failures.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   // check if it was submitted for the same block hash
            // this should be at most 10 iterations
            for (uint256 j = 0; j < specimenHashes.length; j++) {
                address[] storage specimenHashParticipants = bh.participants[specimenHashes[j]];
                for (uint256 k = 0; k < specimenHashParticipants.length; k++)
                    require(specimenHashParticipants[k] != msg.sender, "Operator already submitted for the provided block hash");
            }
```
In this code remember a DOS can happen here because there can be more than 10 iterations, if you look at the comment [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/218d4a583286fa0d3d4263151a927f6cc9465b62/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L370C1-L371C52) 

 it won't result in an error based on the current code.

```solidity
  */
    function finalizeSpecimenSession(uint64 chainId, uint64 blockHeight) public {
        BlockSpecimenSession storage session = _sessions[chainId][blockHeight];
        uint64 sessionDeadline = session.sessionDeadline;
        require(block.number > sessionDeadline, "Session not past deadline");
        require(!session.requiresAudit, "Session cannot be finalized");
        require(sessionDeadline != 0, "Session not started");

        uint256 contributorsN;
        bytes32 specimenHash;

        uint256 max;
        bytes32 agreedBlockHash;
        bytes32 agreedSpecimenHash;

        bytes32[] storage blockHashesRaw = session.blockHashesRaw;
        bytes32 rawBlockHash;
        uint256 blockSpecimenHashesLength = blockHashesRaw.length;

        // find the block hash and specimen hashes that the quorum agrees on by finding the specimen hash with the highest number of participants
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < blockSpecimenHashesLength; i++) {
            rawBlockHash = blockHashesRaw[i];
            BlockProperties storage bh = session.blockProperties[rawBlockHash];
            for (uint256 j = 0; j < bh.specimenHashes.length; j++) {
                specimenHash = bh.specimenHashes[j];
                uint256 len = bh.participants[specimenHash].length;
                contributorsN += len;
                if (len > max) {
                    max = len;
                    agreedBlockHash = rawBlockHash;
                    agreedSpecimenHash = specimenHash;
                }
            }
```

The code responsible for finalizing a specimen session iterates through block hashes and specimen hashes to determine the agreed block hash and specimen hash which will revert because they will be a lot of submitted block specimen([specimen hashes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/218d4a583286fa0d3d4263151a927f6cc9465b62/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L370C1-L371C52))

>Scenerio
Participants:
Alice: Regular participant who submitted multiple specimen proofs.
Bob: Another participant with a significant number of submissions.
Both Alice and Bob have submitted multiple block specimen proofs during the specified session.
The contract owner initiates the finalization process by calling the finalizeSpecimenSession function.
Due to the extensive number of submissions, the loop that iterates through block hashes and specimen hashes encounters challenges related to gas consumption.
The gas required for processing the numerous submissions surpasses the block gas limit.
ansaction Revert:

The transaction attempting to finalize the specimen session gets reverted due to exceeding gas limits.
The extensive number of submissions creates an inefficient iteration process, leading to the transaction failure.

## Impact
 Transactions attempting to finalize the specimen session may fail due to gas limits being exceeded, leading to reverted transactions.
 
## Code Snippet

```solidity

        // find the block hash and specimen hashes that the quorum agrees on by finding the specimen hash with the highest number of participants
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < blockSpecimenHashesLength; i++) {
            rawBlockHash = blockHashesRaw[i];
            BlockProperties storage bh = session.blockProperties[rawBlockHash];
            for (uint256 j = 0; j < bh.specimenHashes.length; j++) {
                specimenHash = bh.specimenHashes[j];
                uint256 len = bh.participants[specimenHash].length;
                contributorsN += len;
                if (len > max) {
                    max = len;
                    agreedBlockHash = rawBlockHash;
                    agreedSpecimenHash = specimenHash;
                }
            }
        }
 ```
        
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a check in the [submit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/218d4a583286fa0d3d4263151a927f6cc9465b62/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L328)

```solidity
// This should be at most 10 iterations
for (uint256 j = 0; j < specimenHashes.length && j < 10; j++) {
    address[] storage specimenHashParticipants = bh.participants[specimenHashes[j]];
    for (uint256 k = 0; k < specimenHashParticipants.length; k++) {
        require(specimenHashParticipants[k] != msg.sender, "Operator already submitted for the provided block hash");
    }
}
```
This will be the 10th iteration submitted. When attempting to finalize the block specimen, it may exceed the gas limit and escape DOS.
