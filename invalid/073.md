# Unfair early advantage in specimenHash selection logic

## Summary
The current method of selecting specimenHash unfairly advantages early entries. It selects the earliest submission with the most participants, disregarding later submissions that have an equal number of participants.

## Vulnerability Detail
The specimenHash selection logic is biased towards earlier submissions.

See BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L416-L429

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < blockSpecimenHashesLength; i++) {
    rawBlockHash = blockHashesRaw[i];
    BlockProperties storage bh = session.blockProperties[rawBlockHash];
    for (uint256 j = 0; j < bh.specimenHashes.length; j++) {
        specimenHash = bh.specimenHashes[j];
        uint256 len = bh.participants[specimenHash].length;
        if (len > max) {
            max = len;
            agreedBlockHash = rawBlockHash;
            agreedSpecimenHash = specimenHash;
        }
    }
}
```

In this logic, the first specimenHash from the initial blockHashes with the highest participant count is selected. Subsequent specimenHashes, even with the same count of participants, are overlooked, whether they are in the same blockHash or later ones.

## Impact
Early submissions are favored based on their position in the iteration order, not because of their inherent validity.

## Recommendation
I am unsure what is the best solution. Maybe consider using submission timestamps as a tiebreaker. If two specimenHashes have the same number of participants, the earlier timestamped submission could be chosen.
