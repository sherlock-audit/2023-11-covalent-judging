# Missing Transaction Order Protections Enable Arbitrage Exploitation

## Summary
The `OperationalStaking` contract contains functions like `redeemRewards`, `stake`, and `unstake` that are vulnerable to front-running attacks. These functions involve token transfers or significant state changes that malicious actors could exploit for profit.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises because these functions do not use any mitigation mechanisms to prevent transaction order manipulation. This allows attackers to observe pending transactions and insert their own transactions to front-run legitimate users.

## Impact
Successful front-running attacks can lead to financial loss for legitimate users through unfavorable rates, lost staking opportunities, or price slippage. Over time, reduced trust in the platform may also lead to declined usage.

  _redeemRewards(validatorId, beneficiary, amount);

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Commit-Reveal Scheme: Implement a 2-phase process to hide sensitive transaction details. 

2. Time-Lock Mechanism: Add a delay between transaction submission and execution.
