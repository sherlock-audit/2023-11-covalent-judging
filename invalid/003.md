# Potential Reentrancy in 'finalizeSpecimenSession' (loss of assets or corruption of intended contract logic)

## Summary
The **finalizeSpecimenSession** function, which interacts with external contracts and updates the contract's state, could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to the sequence of external calls and state updates.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function performs several external calls and state updates without proper reentrancy protection mechanisms. It interacts with external contracts (e.g., token transfers, interactions with the staking contract) and modifies the contract state, creating potential vulnerabilities where callbacks or reentrant calls can manipulate the state in unexpected ways between external calls.
## Impact
Reentrancy attacks can lead to the draining of funds, manipulation of contract state, or unintended changes in the contract's logic flow, resulting in loss of funds or disrupted operations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adopt the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, ensuring that all state changes are made before any external calls. Implement a reentrancy guard to prevent nested or recursive calls from reentering critical functions. Example:

```solidity
bool private _locked;

modifier noReentrancy() {
    require(!_locked, "BlockSpecimenProofChain: Reentrancy detected");
    _locked = true;
    _;
    _locked = false;
}

function finalizeSpecimenSession(uint64 chainId, uint64 blockHeight) public noReentrancy {
    ...
    _finalizeWithParticipants(session, chainId, blockHeight, agreedBlockHash, agreedSpecimenHash);
    ...
}
```
Ensure that critical functions, especially those involving token transfers or interactions with external contracts, are protected against reentrancy.
