# Centralization Risks (single points of failure and targeted attacks)

## Summary
The contract has centralized control points through **onlyGovernor** and **onlyOwner** modifiers, which present risks if the governor or owner account is compromised.
## Vulnerability Detail
The governor and owner accounts have unilateral control over crucial functionalities of the contract, including operator management and system parameter configuration. This centralization presents a significant risk, particularly if these accounts are compromised or if the keys are lost, leading to potential contract paralysis or malicious manipulation.
## Impact
Centralization risks could lead to contract governance being compromised, enabling unauthorized changes, halting of operations, or diversion of funds by manipulating reward distribution logic or other critical parameters.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Decentralize control by implementing a multi-signature mechanism or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model for critical functions. Introduce timelocks for sensitive operations to provide a window for stakeholders to react to unauthorized or malicious changes. Example:

```solidity
function setQuorumThreshold(uint256 quorum) public onlyGovernor timelocked {
    require(quorum > 0 && quorum <= _DIVIDER, "BlockSpecimenProofChain: Invalid quorum threshold");
    _blockSpecimenQuorum = quorum;
    emit SpecimenSessionQuorumChanged(quorum);
}
```
Implement multi-signature requirements for administrative functions and ensure all critical parameter changes go through a governance vote or multi-signature approval.
