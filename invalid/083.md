# BlockSpecimenProofChain::submitBlockSpecimen block number may be incorrectly estimated for some chains

## Summary
The strategy of estimating a block number on target chain used to determine thresholds, would be inadapted in some cases such as variable block time chains, or in even in the case of Moonbeam, in the case of a chain halt.

## Vulnerability Detail
On the 3 Apr 2023 Moonbeam experienced an outage due to an upgrade:
https://moonbeam.network/blog/block-production-interruption-root-cause/

This caused the block `3291300` to be produced approx `4 hours, 12 minutes, and 24` after `3291299` was produced instead of target 12 seconds.

This would break the constant block time estimation used by Covalent here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L342-L344

And potentially prevent the correct submission of some block specimens.

## Impact
Some block specimens may not be produced

## Recommendation
Fix does not seem trivial, please consider having a more flexible approach to block number estimation on target chain
