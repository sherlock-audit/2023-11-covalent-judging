# Msg.sender can still send multiple submission even though there is a check: require(specimenHashParticipants[k] != msg.sender, "Operator already submitted for the provided block hash") with same specimen

## Summary
The vulnerability arises from the code's failure to account for different blockHashes associated with the same specimenHash within the same session. As a result, an attacker could exploit this gap, submitting multiple specimens for the same specimenHash and potentially disrupting the intended operation of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  function submitBlockSpecimenProof(uint64 chainId, uint64 blockHeight, bytes32 blockHash, bytes32 specimenHash, string calldata storageURL) external {
        require(_blockSpecimenProducers.contains(msg.sender), "Sender is not BLOCK_SPECIMEN_PRODUCER_ROLE");
        ChainData storage cd = _chainData[chainId];
        require(cd.nthBlock != 0, "Invalid chain ID");
        require(blockHeight % cd.nthBlock == 0, "Invalid block height");

        BlockSpecimenSession storage session = _sessions[chainId][blockHeight];
        uint64 sessionDeadline = session.sessionDeadline;
        SessionParticipantData storage participantsData = session.participantsData[msg.sender];

            require(block.number <= sessionDeadline, "Session submissions have closed");
            require(participantsData.submissionCounter < cd.maxSubmissionsPerBlockHeight, "Max submissions limit exceeded");

            BlockProperties storage bh = session.blockProperties[blockHash];
            bytes32[] storage specimenHashes = bh.specimenHashes;

            uint128 validatorID = validatorIDs[msg.sender];
            require(_validatorEnabled[validatorID], "Validator is not enabled");

            // check if it was submitted for the same block hash
            // this should be at most 10 iterations
            for (uint256 j = 0; j < specimenHashes.length; j++) {
                address[] storage specimenHashParticipants = bh.participants[specimenHashes[j]];
                for (uint256 k = 0; k < specimenHashParticipants.length; k++)
                    require(specimenHashParticipants[k] != msg.sender, "Operator already submitted for the provided block hash");
            }

            address[] storage participants = bh.participants[specimenHash];
            if (specimenHashes.length != 0) {
                if (participants.length == 0) specimenHashes.push(specimenHash);
            } else {
                session.blockHashesRaw.push(blockHash);
                specimenHashes.push(specimenHash);
            }

            participants.push(msg.sender);
            participantsData.submissionCounter++;
        }
        _urls[specimenHash].push(storageURL);

        emit BlockSpecimenProductionProofSubmitted(chainId, blockHeight, blockHash, specimenHash, storageURL);
    }
```
The submitBlockSpecimenProof function in the provided smart contract lacks a comprehensive check to ensure that the same operator (msg.sender) cannot submit multiple specimens for the same specimenHash within the same block height and session. The current implementation does not consider submissions with different blockHashes during the same session, creating a vulnerability 
that could be exploited by an attacker to submit duplicate specimens.

>scenario
The attacker submits a specimen with blockHash1 and a specific specimenHash during a session.
Subsequently, the attacker submits another specimen with a different blockHash2 but the same specimenHash during the same session.
The contract allows both submissions, indicating a failure to prevent duplicate submissions for the same specimenHash within the same session.

>in essence

In the initial state, the BlockSpecimenSession is set up, and let's assume the session has a valid sessionDeadline and other necessary parameters.

Now, the attacker makes the first submission with blockHash1 and the specimenHash. The code executes the loop, checks if the operator (attacker) has already submitted for the provided specimenHash, and adds the operator to the participants for the corresponding specimenHash.

However, the vulnerability arises when the attacker makes the second submission with a different blockHash (e.g., blockHash2) but the same specimenHash. The loop iterates over the specimenHashes array associated with the first blockHash1 and checks if the operator(msg.sender) has already submitted for the specimenHash. Since the loop doesn't account for the second submission with a different blockHash, it may not detect the previous submission, leading to the attacker successfully submitting multiple specimens for the same specimenHash within the same block height and session.

this [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/218d4a583286fa0d3d4263151a927f6cc9465b62/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L375) doesn't prevent the same operator (msg.sender) from submitting multiple specimens for the same specimenHash within the same block height and session. If an attacker repeatedly calls the submitBlockSpecimenProof function with the same specimenHash during the same session, the loop will not detect the previous submissions by the same operator for that specific specimenHash.

## Impact
The lack of a unique submission check could disrupt the normal operation of the contract during the submission phase.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
implement a more robust check in the loop to consider submissions with different blockHashes associated with the same specimenHash within the same session. This ensures that an operator cannot submit multiple specimens for the same specimenHash regardless of the associated blockHash.

Or add this check
```solidity
  function isSessionOpen(uint64 chainId, uint64 blockHeight, address operator) public view returns (bool) {
        BlockSpecimenSession storage session = _sessions[chainId][blockHeight];
        uint64 sessionDeadline = session.sessionDeadline;
        SessionParticipantData storage participantsData = session.participantsData[operator];
        bool submissionLimitExceeded = participantsData.submissionCounter == _chainData[chainId].maxSubmissionsPerBlockHeight;
        return (!submissionLimitExceeded && block.number <= sessionDeadline) || (sessionDeadline == 0 && !session.requiresAudit);
    }
```

```solidity
else {
        -    require(block.number <= sessionDeadline, "Session submissions have closed");
        +  require(!submissionLimitExceeded && block.number <= sessionDeadline) 
            require(participantsData.submissionCounter < cd.maxSubmissionsPerBlockHeight, "Max submissions limit exceeded");

            BlockProperties storage bh = session.blockProperties[blockHash];
            bytes32[] storage specimenHashes = bh.specimenHashes;

            uint128 validatorID = validatorIDs[msg.sender];
            require(_validatorEnabled[validatorID], "Validator is not enabled");

            // check if it was submitted for the same block hash
            // this should be at most 10 iterations
            for (uint256 j = 0; j < specimenHashes.length; j++) {
                address[] storage specimenHashParticipants = bh.participants[specimenHashes[j]];
                for (uint256 k = 0; k < specimenHashParticipants.length; k++)
                    require(specimenHashParticipants[k] != msg.sender, "Operator already submitted for the provided block hash");
            }

            address[] storage participants = bh.participants[specimenHash];
            if (specimenHashes.length != 0) {
                if (participants.length == 0) specimenHashes.push(specimenHash);
            } else {
                session.blockHashesRaw.push(blockHash);
                specimenHashes.push(specimenHash);
            }

            participants.push(msg.sender);
            participantsData.submissionCounter++;
        }
        _urls[specimenHash].push(storageURL);

        emit BlockSpecimenProductionProofSubmitted(chainId, blockHeight, blockHash, specimenHash, storageURL);
    }
```
It is important to note that the code in question has a built-in limitation that restricts the user (msg.sender) from submitting more than 11 iterations. In case the user attempts to make the 11th submission, the code will automatically revert and prevent any further submissions. This functionality is implemented using a specific line of code, which can be found at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/218d4a583286fa0d3d4263151a927f6cc9465b62/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L551C1-L557C6.
