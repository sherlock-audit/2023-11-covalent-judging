# If the seconds per Block changes for any of the chain then noone will able to submit blockspecimen proof.

## Summary
If the seconds per Block changes for any of the chain then noone will able to submit blockspecimen proof. as it will not pass this require statement and hence DOS.

## Vulnerability Detail

As how protocol is calculating the currentBlock on target chain if the seconds per Block changes in any of the chain result in DOS.
If  seconds per Block in increased in one chain

```solidity
require(lowerBound <= blockHeight && blockHeight <= currentBlockOnTargetChain + cd.allowedThreshold, "Block height is out of bounds for live sync");
```
We will get "lock height is out of bounds for live sync" error.
