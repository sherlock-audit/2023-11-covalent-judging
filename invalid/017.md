# Potential Unbounded Loop in getDelegatorMetadata Function

## Summary
The **getDelegatorMetadata** function retrieves a delegator's metadata, including information about ongoing unstaking processes. However, the function includes a loop through all unstakings of a delegator, which could potentially lead to unbounded gas consumption.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the **getDelegatorMetadata** function, there's a loop that iterates over all unstakings of a delegator. If a delegator has a large number of unstaking records, the loop might consume an excessive amount of gas, possibly leading to out-of-gas errors or making the function expensive to call.
## Impact
This issue might not only cause high gas costs but also make the function fail due to block gas limits, rendering the function unusable for delegators with a large number of unstakings.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the risk of unbounded loops and high gas costs, consider implementing a paginated approach to retrieving unstaking records. This can be done by allowing callers to specify a range of indexes for the unstakings they are interested in. This approach limits the amount of data processed in a single transaction, reducing the risk of excessive gas consumption and out-of-gas errors. Here's a snippet demonstrating a possible implementation:

```solidity
function getDelegatorMetadataPaginated(
    address delegator,
    uint128 validatorId,
    uint256 start,
    uint256 end
) external view returns (
    uint128 staked,
    uint128 rewards,
    uint128 commissionEarned,
    uint128[] memory unstakingAmounts,
    uint128[] memory unstakingsEndEpochs
) {
    //...
    require(start <= end && end <= unstakings.length, "Invalid start or end");
    uint256 length = end - start;
    unstakingAmounts = new uint128[](length);
    unstakingsEndEpochs = new uint128[](length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        unstakingAmounts[i] = unstakings[start + i].amount;
        unstakingsEndEpochs[i] = unstakings[start + i].coolDownEnd;
    }
    //...
}
```
This approach ensures that the function's gas consumption is predictable and under control, regardless of the number of unstakings a delegator has.
