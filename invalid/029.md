# BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#submitBlockSpecimenProof() - arbitrary ``storageURL`` can contain malicious string data

## Summary
The ``submitBlockSpecimenProof()`` is used by operators to submit their specimen hashes, making them eligible for rewards if they hash is the most submitted one. They also provide a block height, block hash and a storage URL supposed to represent an IPFS URL addresses, which pass no input validation.

## Vulnerability Detail
At the end of the given function after the hash is successfully validated and the participant is added to the hash's array, we push the given arbitrary string to the URLs array. Due to the string passing no input validation and the fact that these URLs would be playing a more major part in other parts of the Covalent system to "fetch the specimens and then process it further.", we are completely free to assume any maliciously crafted strings of arbitrary data, such as JSON injections, SQL injections, malicious escape characters, wrong addresses, malicious URLs, etc., could deem problematic for the overall system.
The storage URL passed is a part of both a view function for the off-chain and an event during proof submission that is bound to be read and used as well.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There is no easy way to protect against mentioned phishing IPFS content, but having an on-chain check that the string contains the required "/ipfs/" identifier would be a good way to mitigate all non-IPFS arbitrary data that could be passed.
