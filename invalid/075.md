# New exchange rate miscalculation arising from updated commission rates

## Summary
New exchange rate miscalculation arising from updated commission rates.

## Vulnerability Detail
Accurate calculation of the exchange rate is critical for determining both stake and share amounts. The exchange rate is initially set and later adjusted in the contract as follows:

```solidity
v.exchangeRate = uint128(DIVIDER);
```

```solidity
v.exchangeRate += uint128((uint256(amount - commissionPaid) * uint256(DIVIDER)) / v.totalShares);
```

In the staking process (_stake function), totalShares is calculated using the current exchange rate:

```solidity
uint128 sharesAdd = _tokensToShares(amount, v.exchangeRate);

// other code

v.totalShares += sharesAdd;
```

However, when the commission rate is altered (via setValidatorCommissionRate), the rewardValidators function calculates the commission paid using the new commission rate but against the v.totalShares with old commission rate when recalculate the exchangeRate:

```solidity
commissionPaid = uint128((uint256(amount) * uint256(v.commissionRate)) / DIVIDER);

// other code

v.exchangeRate += uint128((uint256(amount - commissionPaid) * uint256(DIVIDER)) / v.totalShares);
```

## Impact
This can lead to an incorrect exchange rate calculation, affecting the integrity of staking calculations.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recompute v.totalShares using the new commission rate instead of relying on its outdated value. This will ensure the accuracy of the exchange rate and the fairness of the staking system.
