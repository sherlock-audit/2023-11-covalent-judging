# Lack of Balance Validation Before Token Transfer

## Summary
The `_redeemRewards` function in the `OperationalStaking` contract does not adequately check that the contract has enough tokens to fulfill redemption requests. This can lead to failed transactions and negative user experiences.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_redeemRewards` internal function calculates the reward amount, emits a redemption event, and transfers tokens to the beneficiary. However, it does not verify that the contract's token balance can cover the transfer. 

## Impact
If the contract balance is insufficient, the `_transferFromContract` call will fail. This causes transaction failure, gas wastage for users, and loss of trust due to frequent errors.
