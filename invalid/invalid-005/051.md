# Wrong access control on setValidatorCommissionRate()

## Summary

According to the Sherlock README the Staking manager should be allowed to set the Validator Commission Rate.
`What the StakingManager can do: Set the validator commission rate`

But the setValidatorCommissionRate() function has the onlyOwner() modifier, which allows only the contract owner to set the commission rate.  

## Vulnerability Detail
The setValidatorCommissionRate() has the onlyOwner modifier.
 
```solidity
function setValidatorCommissionRate(uint128 validatorId, uint128 amount) external onlyOwner {
```

It should use the onlyStakingManager() instead. 

## Impact

Wrong access control, Staking manager can not change commission rate.
This destroys core functionality with no quick fix.
