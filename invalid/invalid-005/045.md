# setValidatorCommissionRate should be called by staking manager

## Summary

In readme.md, it is mentioned that the responsibilities of the staking manager are as follows:

> - Set the validator commission rate
> 
> - Add validator instances to the contract
> 
> - Reward validators
> 
> - Disable/Enable validators

What the owner can do:

> - Deposit tokens into the contract that will be distributed (reward pool)
> 
> - Withdraw tokens from the contract that are supposed to be distributed. The owner cannot withdraw tokens allocated for the past checkpoints that have not yet been redeemed by the delegators
> 
> - Set the validator max cap multiplier
> 
> - Set the maximum number of tokens the validator can stake
> 
> - Set the StakingManager address
> 
> - Renounce his role and disable all the following listed actions by calling renounceOwnership
> 
> - Transfer the ownership to another address by calling transferOwnership
> 
> - Set or change the stakingManager by calling setStakingManagerAddress

These actions of owner do not include setting the validator commission rate.

But the current implementation of `setValidatorCommissionRate` can only be called by the owner. Staking manager doesn't set the validator commission rate.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: cqt-staking\contracts\OperationalStaking.sol
362:->   function setValidatorCommissionRate(uint128 validatorId, uint128 amount) external onlyOwner {
363:         require(validatorId < validatorsN, "Invalid validator");
364:         require(amount < DIVIDER, "Rate must be less than 100%");
365:         _validators[validatorId].commissionRate = amount;
366:         emit ValidatorCommissionRateChanged(validatorId, amount);
367:     }
```

`setValidatorCommissionRate` has the `onlyOwner` modifier, which means that the function can only be called by the owner.

## Impact

This breaks the assumption of the protocol: staking manager can set the commission rate.
