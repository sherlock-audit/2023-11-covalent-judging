# Anyone can redeem any delegator's or validator's reward

## Summary
There is no beneficiary address check in the `_redeemRewards` function makes all rewards accessible for anyone. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Attackers can call the `redeemAllRewards` or `redeemRewards` function and specify their address as the beneficiary address, with any validatorId. There are no restrictions on the beneficiary address, which means that anyone could potentially steal all of the rewards. 

## Impact
Anyone can redeem any delegator's or validator's reward.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add this line like in the function `redeemCommission`.
```diff
    function _redeemRewards(uint128 validatorId, address beneficiary, uint128 amount) internal {
        require(validatorId < validatorsN, "Invalid validator");
        require(beneficiary != address(0x0), "Invalid beneficiary");
        Validator storage v = _validators[validatorId];
        Staking storage s = v.stakings[msg.sender];
+		require(v._address == msg.sender, "The sender is not the validator");
        require(!v.frozen, "Validator is frozen");
```
