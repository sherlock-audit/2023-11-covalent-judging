# `BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol::finalizeSpecimenSession` should be called automatically by oracle, else noone will receive the rewards for the work.

## Summary
`BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol::finalizeSpecimenSession` should be called automatically by oracle. If no one called the function with correct data then quorum will never be achieved even with majority 

## Vulnerability Detail
If `BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol::finalizeSpecimenSession` function is not called by anyone with correct data then quorum will not be finalized and no one will receive their rewards for their work.

## Impact
High

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use Chainlink Automation tool which will call this function periodically hence everyone will get rewards for their POW
