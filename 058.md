# Incomplete Implementation of `renounceOwnership` Function Prevents Owner from Renouncing Ownership

## Summary

The implementation of `renounceOwnership` is not correctly implemented, resulting in the inability of the contract owner to renounce their ownership.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `OperationalStaking.sol` contract, the `renounceOwnership` function, is not implemented. It overwrites the implementation from the `OwnableUpgradeable` contract. Furthermore, in the documentation, it is said that the owners are able to renounce his role and disable all the following listed actions by calling renounceOwnership.

## Impact

The owner is unable to renounce his ownership which is a feature that is supposed to be a functionality as stated in the docs. There is discrepancy between the implementation and the documentation.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L860

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() public virtual override onlyOwner {
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the function implementation. This way it won't override the default implementation from `OwnableUpgradeable`.
