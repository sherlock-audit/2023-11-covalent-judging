# No need to run validator just frontrun the transaction.

## Summary
No need to run the validaor node setup you should be valid validator and you can copy the transaction and frontrun the transaction by other validator and get the rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

Function `BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol::submitBlockSpecimenProof` any valid validator can call but attacker can become valid validator and will do the frontrun. Suppose a validator runs the node and creates `blockhash` and `specimenHash` and calls `submitBlockSpecimenProof` function. An attacker will read the transaction from mempool and frontrun and will get rewards even no-need to frontrun just copy-pasting the transaction will work. Hence no need to run the node just copy the transaction.
