# An operators can submit another's specimen proofs, without actual proof of work.

## Summary
An operator can use the values that another operator used for submitting specimen proof, without actually calculating the specimen hash.

## Vulnerability Detail
The values for submit a specimen proof can be replayed. An opeator can extract the values used to submit block specimen proof from the contract storage or from transactions. Then he can use these values to submit proof for that block on order for that proof gets agreed and get reward. But he doesn't actually put any effort to calculate the specimen hash. This makes the contract consensus vulnerable to be manipulated.

```solidity
328:    function submitBlockSpecimenProof(uint64 chainId, uint64 blockHeight, bytes32 blockHash, bytes32 specimenHash, string calldata storageURL) external {

## Impact
Specimen proofs can be replayed without effort, making the contract consensus vulnerable to be manipulated.
