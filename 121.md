# Inequitable Reward Distribution When Pool is Depleted

## Summary
The `OperationalStaking` contract's `rewardValidators` function contains insufficient logic to handle reward pool depletion scenarios. This leads to inequitable distribution, lack of transparency for validators, and centralized control risks.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current check `if (newRewardPool < amount)` does not adequately handle scenarios where the reward pool is depleted before rewarding all validators. It simply emits an event and continues.

## Impact
Validators who are processed later miss out on rewards despite equal eligibility. This causes confusion and unfairness, reducing trust in the reward distribution mechanism.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L274C13-L277C14

```solidity
if (newRewardPool < amount) {

  emit RewardFailedDueLowPool(validatorId, amount);
  
  continue;

}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement pro-rata distribution to split available rewards proportionally when facing depletion. Also consider dynamic reward calculations based on the pool rather than fixed amounts.
