# Reward distribution can be sandwiched

## Summary
Implementation of reward distribution is vulnerable to sandwich attacks.

## Vulnerability Details

Adversary can frontrun reward distribution with `stake`, backrun it with `unstake`, claim the rewards immediately, and withdraw their original CQT in 28 days, earning the same pro-rata rewards as honest stakers.

Although they can not withdraw CQT immediately, their only risk is CQT decreasing in value during the next 28 days. If, for example, rewards are distributed once a quarter, this would mean the sandwichers will need to lock their CQT only for 1/3 of the time to get full rewards.

During these 28 days, if suddenly more rewards are allocated, they can sandwich them too via `recoverUnstaking`, resetting their 28 day withdrawal period. 

## Impact
1. Honest stakers receive less yield.
2. Users staking outside of these 28-day periods have no benefits over the sandwichers in terms of rewards, and are prone to CQT price fluctiations.

## Recommendation
Make the staking two-step with warm-up period, so the sandwiching will no longer be viable.
