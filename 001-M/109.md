# Front-run attack on `rewardValidators()`

## Summary
`rewardValidators()`  is susceptible to front-running, allowing attackers to capture protocol rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `rewardValidators()` function, the protocol distributes rewards to Validators, thereby increasing the `exchangeRate`. 
```solidity
            v.exchangeRate += uint128((uint256(amount - commissionPaid) * uint256(DIVIDER)) / v.totalShares);

            // commission is not compounded
            // commisison is distributed under the validator instance
            v.commissionAvailableToRedeem += commissionPaid;

            newRewardPool -= amount;

```

However, front-running is possible here. A malicious actor could observe that the staking manager is preparing to distribute rewards to Validators, stake in advance, wait for the rewards to be distributed and the `exchangeRate` to increase, quickly call `redeemAllRewards()` to claim the rewards, and then proceed to unstake.


## Impact
The protocol is susceptible to front-running for obtaining rewards.
