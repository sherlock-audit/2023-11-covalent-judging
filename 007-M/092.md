# The session result can be manipulated by preventing quorum attainment through multiple calls to `submitBlockSpecimenProof`

## Summary

In the `BlockSpecimenProofChain` contract, the `submitBlockSpecimenProof` function allows` _blockSpecimenProducers` role to submit block specimen proofs. Under the constraint that, for the same `blockhash`, a producer can only submit one `specimenHash`, the total submissions for the same producer across different `blockHash` are limited by `maxSubmissionsPerBlockHeigh`. However, in the `finalizeSpecimenSession` function, excessive submissions to different block hashes by a malicious producer for a session could increase the `contributorsN` value in the condition `(max * _DIVIDER) / contributorsN > _blockSpecimenQuorum`. This can ultimately prevent the invocation of the `_finalizeWithParticipants` function due to the failure to meet the quorum condition, resulting in agreed `blockHash` and `specimenHash` not being finalized. The root cause of this issue is that the `contributorsN` calculated in the `finalizeSpecimenSession` function counts the total number of submissions in a session rather than the total number of participants.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Assuming `_minSubmissionsRequired == 2`, `maxSubmissionsPerBlockHeight == 3`, if producer A calls `submitBlockSpecimenProof(chainId_1, blockHeight_1, blockHash_1, specimenHash_1, storageURL_1)`, producer B `calls submitBlockSpecimenProof(chainId_1, blockHeight_1, blockHash_1, specimenHash_1, storageURL_2)`, and producer C calls `submitBlockSpecimenProof(chainId_1, blockHeight_1, blockHash_1, specimenHash_2, storageURL_3)`, and the session ends at this point, the final agreed `blockHash` should be `blockHash_1`, and the agreed `specimenHash` should be `specimenHash_1`.
2. If, before the session ends, producer C maliciously calls `submitBlockSpecimenProof(chainId_1, blockHeight_1, blockHash_2, specimenHash_3, storageURL_4)` and `submitBlockSpecimenProof(chainId_1, blockHeight_1, blockHash_3, specimenHash_4, storageURL_5)`, then, due to the constraint `(max * _DIVIDER) / contributorsN > _blockSpecimenQuorum`, the final agreed `blockHash` and `specimenHash` cannot be finalized.

## Impact

if a malicious producer continuously submits block specimen proofs with different block hashes before the session has ended, it could prevent the determination of the final agreed `blockHash` and `specimenHash`.

## Recommendation

 It is recommended using the following line of code to calculate `contributorsN`:

```solidity
contributorsN = session.participantsData.length;
```
