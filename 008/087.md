# `sharesToBurn` on redeeming rewards doesn't rounding up, which tend towards favoring validators and Covalent slowly loosing the CQT

## Summary

`sharesToBurn` on redeeming rewards doesn't rounding up making validator slightly getting more advantage, while Covalent slowly loosing the CQT

## Vulnerability Detail

On redeeming, `sharesToBurn` amount which is returning from `_tokensToShares` doesn't rounding up, making validator slightly getting more advantage, they are getting amount of CQT with lesser share to burn, thus Covalent will slowly decreasing their CQT

As we can see, `_tokensToShares` function clearly do a rounding down.

also, on line 620, reasoning of conversion inconsistency and sanity check doesn't related with this issue.

This rounding down, will make redeeming will burn or decrease lesser `share` than the amount (`effectiveAmount`).

```js
File: OperationalStaking.sol
393:     function _tokensToShares(uint128 amount, uint128 rate) internal pure returns (uint128) {
394:         return uint128((uint256(amount) * DIVIDER) / uint256(rate));
395:     }
...
589:     function _redeemRewards(uint128 validatorId, address beneficiary, uint128 amount) internal {
...
611:         uint128 effectiveAmount = isRedeemingAll ? totalUnlockedValue : amount;
612: 
613:         // can only redeem above redeem threshold
614:         require(effectiveAmount >= REWARD_REDEEM_THRESHOLD, "Requested amount must be higher than redeem threshold");
615: 
616:         uint128 sharesToBurn = _tokensToShares(effectiveAmount, v.exchangeRate);
617: 
618:         // sometimes, due to conversion inconsistencies, sharesToBurn might end up larger than s.shares;
619:         // so we clamp sharesToBurn to s.shares (the redeemer gets trivially more value out in this case)
620:         if (sharesToBurn > s.shares) sharesToBurn = s.shares;
621: 
622:         // sanity check: sharesToBurn should never be zero while effectiveAmount is nonzero, as this
623:         // would enable infinite draining of funds
624:         require(sharesToBurn > 0, "Underflow error");
625: 
626:         unchecked {
627:             v.totalShares -= sharesToBurn;
628:         }
629:         unchecked {
630:             s.shares -= sharesToBurn;
631:         }
632: 
633:         emit RewardRedeemed(validatorId, beneficiary, effectiveAmount);
634:         _transferFromContract(beneficiary, effectiveAmount);
635:     }
```

## Impact

Covalent slowly loosing the CQT reward due to burn share rounding more towards to validator
