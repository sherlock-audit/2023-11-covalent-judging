# Accumulated Discrepancies from Repeated Rounding in Token Conversion

## Summary
The `OperationalStaking` contract contains conversion functions like `_sharesToTokens` and `_tokensToShares` that are vulnerable to rounding errors leading to balance discrepancies over time.

## Vulnerability Detail
The logic uses fixed-point arithmetic to convert between shares and tokens. However, the use of the `DIVIDER` constant and rounding down can introduce minor discrepancies that accumulate through repeated transactions.

## Impact 
Users may notice inconsistent staked balances and rewards, potentially losing trust. Large unaccounted rounding errors may also represent a monetary loss for users.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _sharesToTokens(uint128 sharesN, uint128 rate) internal pure returns (uint128) {

  return uint128((uint256(sharesN) * uint256(rate)) / DIVIDER); 

}

function _tokensToShares(uint128 amount, uint128 rate) internal pure returns (uint128) {

  return uint128((uint256(amount) * DIVIDER) / uint256(rate));

}
```
