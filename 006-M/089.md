# When updating the validator address with the `setValidatorAddress` function, the delegated amount is not adjusted which may lead to the validator’s potential losses

## Summary

In the `setValidatorAddress` function of the `OperationalStaking` contract, the validator address self-updates the address information for the corresponding `validatorId` and invalidates the old validator address. However, if the new validator address was previously delegated tokens to the corresponding `validatorId` using the `stake` function, the delegation amount should be subtracted from `_validators[validatorId].delegated` after this address becomes the new validator address. Failure to do so may result in an excessive `_validators[validatorId].delegated` number for the new validator address, causing potential losses.

## Vulnerability Detail

Considering the following scenario:
1. Address A is `_validators[0]._address`, and Address B calls `stake(0, delegationMaxCap)`.
2. Address A calls `setValidatorAddress(0, Address B)`, making Address B the new `_validators[0]._address`.
3. Tokens staked by Address B before becoming the new validator address can no longer be unstaked because calling the `unstake` function would trigger the constraint `v.delegated <= newValidatorMaxCap`.

## Impact

An inflation of `_validators[validatorId].delegated` beyond the actual value can lead to the following two impacts:
1. Some tokens staked by the new validator address cannot be unstaked.
2. The ability to stake the maximum token quantity into the corresponding `validatorId` is reduced due to the constraint `v.delegated + amount <= delegationMaxCap`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add the additional code below the `require(!v.frozen, "Validator is frozen”);` line in the `setValidatorAddres`s function:

```solidity
v.delegated -= v.stakings[newAddress].staked;
```
This line ensures that the `delegated` value is adjusted by subtracting the staked amount associated with the new address in the `setValidatorAddress`  function.
