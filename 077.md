# Numerous Unchecked Inputs can lead to malfunctioning of protocol

## Summary
Some inputs are unchecked which can lead to adverse effect in the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
Throughout the codebase, there are places where a proper input/output validation is lacking. In particular:
- `getValidatorCompoundedStakingData` function in `OperationalStaking.sol` doesnt check if the `validatorId` passed is correct/valid just as they've been checking from other functions ( `require(validatorId < validatorsN, "Invalid validator");` )
- `disableValidator ` function in BlockResultProofChain.sol doesn't confirm if the `validatorId` passed in is correct and secondly, doesnt check if the validator is "currently enabled"
- `enableValidator ` function in BlockResultProofChain.sol doesn't confirm if the `validatorId` passed in is correct and secondly, doesnt check if the validator is "currently disabled"

## Impact
A lack of validation on parameters may result in erroneous or failing transactions that are difficult to debug. 
To avoid errors, wasting of protocol resources and unexpected system behavior, consider implementing require statements to validate all inputs as advised.

## Tool used
Intense staring at the codebase

## Recommendation
- For `getValidatorCompoundedStakingData`, make sure input is checked i.e `require(validatorId < validatorsN, "Invalid validator");`
- For `disableValidator`, confirm that validator is currently enabled and validatorId is valid i.e `require(validatorId < validatorsN, "Invalid validator");` `require(_validatorEnabled[validatorId], "Validator is disabled already")`
- For `enableValidator`, confirm that validator is currently disabled and validatorId is valid i.e `require(validatorId < validatorsN, "Invalid validator");` `require(!_validatorEnabled[validatorId], "Validator is enabled already")`
