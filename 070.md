# Missing Storage Gap and _disableInitializers

## Summary
For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to “allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments”. Otherwise, it may be very difficult to write new implementation code. Without storage gap, the variable in the contract contract might be overwritten by the upgraded contract if new variables are added. This could have unintended and very serious consequences to the child contracts.

To ensure the proper functioning of upgradable contracts, it is essential to include a constructor with the "_disableInitializers()" function.

## Vulnerability Detail
Several contracts are intended to be upgradeable contracts in the code base, including:
`BlockSpecimenProofChain `
`OperationalStaking `

contract BlockSpecimenProofChain is OwnableUpgradeable {
```

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure upgradable contracts include a state variable, typically named "__gap," to reserve storage space. This enables the addition of new state variables in future upgrades without affecting storage compatibility with existing deployments.

Please reference OpenZeppelin upgradeable contract templates. uint256[50] private __gap;

Ensure that upgradable contracts have a constructor with _disableInitializers() to lock the implementation contract when it is deployed.
