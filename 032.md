# BlockSpecimenProofChain::finalizeSpecimenSession() is buggy, can result in BlockspecimenSession never getting finalized

## Summary
finalizeSpecimenSession() is a public function and hence can be called by any one, any number of times. Calling this functions **before reaching the quorum()** will **permanently block** this session from finalization.

**This is a critical vulnerability.**

## Vulnerability Detail

Refer to the below code snippet from finalizeSpecimenSession(), where the logic tries to evaluate if the quorum() was reached.
If the quorum() is reached, the finalization of specimen with participants will happen.

```solidity
      // check if the number of submissions is sufficient and if the quorum is achieved
        if (_minSubmissionsRequired <= max && (max * _DIVIDER) / contributorsN > _blockSpecimenQuorum) {
            // TODO: doesn't free session space. Though it should.
            _finalizeWithParticipants(session, chainId, blockHeight, agreedBlockHash, agreedSpecimenHash);
        } else emit QuorumNotReached(chainId, blockHeight);

        session.requiresAudit = true;
        // set session deadline to 0 to release gas
        session.sessionDeadline = 0;
```

But, incase he quorum was not reached, then the logic emits QuorumNotReached event, and marks the session with **requiresAudit** as true.  Refer to the last 3 lines in the above code snippet.

Setting requiresAudit as true before finalization will conflict with finalization process as the finalizeSpecimenSession() cannot be called for this session. The finalizeSpecimenSession() will revert.

Refer to the last two lines in the below code snippet, where the condition being checked is that **requiresAudit** should be **false**.
Hence, BlockSpecimenSession will never get finalized.

```solidity
 function finalizeSpecimenSession(uint64 chainId, uint64 blockHeight) public {
        BlockSpecimenSession storage session = _sessions[chainId][blockHeight];
        uint64 sessionDeadline = session.sessionDeadline;
        require(block.number > sessionDeadline, "Session not past deadline");
        require(!session.requiresAudit, "Session cannot be finalized");
        require(sessionDeadline != 0, "Session not started");
```
## Impact
BlockSpecimenSession will never get finalized.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, set the requiresAudit and sessionDeadline values only if finalizeWithParticipants() was completed successfully.

As a demonstration, adjust the code as below.

```solidity
        // check if the number of submissions is sufficient and if the quorum is achieved
        if (_minSubmissionsRequired <= max && (max * _DIVIDER) / contributorsN > _blockSpecimenQuorum) {
            // TODO: doesn't free session space. Though it should.
            _finalizeWithParticipants(session, chainId, blockHeight, agreedBlockHash, agreedSpecimenHash);
          + session.requiresAudit = true;
          + // set session deadline to 0 to release gas
          + session.sessionDeadline = 0;
        } else emit QuorumNotReached(chainId, blockHeight);

       - session.requiresAudit = true;
       - // set session deadline to 0 to release gas
       - session.sessionDeadline = 0;
```
