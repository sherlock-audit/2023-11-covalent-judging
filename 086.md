# Incomplete `README.md` which can mislead researchers.

## Summary
In the  `README.md`  file at [line 74](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L74), some functions have not been added to the Governor role but they assume that role

## Vulnerability Detail
looking at [`setBlockHeightSubmissionsThreshold`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L312-L315) and [`setSecondsPerBlock` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L317-L323) function you will observe that they assume the Governor role with the [`onlyGovernor`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L115-L118) modifier.
But in the `README.md` you will not find these functions specified in the Governor role section.

## Impact
The specified section in the README misinforms researchers

## Code Snippet
Functions with the role:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The Governor role in the ProofChain Contract under the question ["Q: Are there any additional protocol roles? If yes, please explain in detail:
"](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L74) needs to be updated with these functions: `setBlockHeightSubmissionsThreshold()` and `setSecondsPerBlock()`
