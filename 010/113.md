# When validators stake, there is a lack of a minimum stake amount check

## Summary
When a validator is staking, the protocol does not check the minimum stake amount, resulting in validators being easily disabled.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_stake()` function, when a validator is staking, the protocol only checks that the validator's stake does not exceed `validatorMaxStake`, but it does not check the minimum stake required for validators.
```solidity
      if (isValidator) {
            // compares with newStaked to ignore compounded rewards
            require(newStaked <= validatorMaxStake, "Validator max stake exceeded");
        } else {
            // cannot stake more than validator delegation max cap
            uint128 delegationMaxCap = v.stakings[v._address].staked * maxCapMultiplier;
            uint128 newDelegated = v.delegated + amount;
            require(newDelegated <= delegationMaxCap, "Validator max delegation exceeded");
            v.delegated = newDelegated;
        }
```

## Impact
Validators are susceptible to being disabled easily during unstake().

## Recommendation
When a validator is staking, add a check for `newStaked >= validatorEnableMinStake`.
