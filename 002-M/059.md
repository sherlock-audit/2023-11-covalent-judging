# Risk of Validator Address Change Failure Due to Unbounded Growth of Unstaking Array

## Summary

Validators may be unable to change their address due to the unbounded growth of the `Unstaking` array, which is capped at length of 300.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `setValidatorAddress` function, the `Unstaking` array associated with the current validator's address is transferred to a new address. There is no mechanism to reduce the array size. Over time, the array size might exceed the capped limit of 300. This will eventually prevent the validator from changing their address since it will revert once the length is over 300. 

## Impact

If the length exceeds 300, validators will not be able to change their address, locking them to an address, causing them not able to transfer their address and they are stuck to that particular address. It can be detrimental if validators are required to change to reference another address but unable to do.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L702

```solidity
require(length <= 300, "Cannot transfer more than 300 unstakings");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing a function where it will remove the element once the unstaking value reached 0. This way, the length can be contained.
