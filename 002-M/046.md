# setValidatorAddress may never be successfully executed in some cases

## Summary

[[setValidatorAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L689)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L689) is used to change the validator address. Here there will be a check that [[the length of the unstakings array of the current validator address cannot exceed 300](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L702)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L702), otherwise tx will be revert. After the check passes, the unstakings array of the old address will be entirely copied to the unstakings array of the new address. This is not a good practice, because the unstakings array contains useless unstaking (amount=0), and copying these useless unstaking makes no meaning.

Therefore, as time goes by, the unstakings array will become larger and larger. When its length exceeds 300, the validator can no longer set a new address.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: cqt-staking\contracts\OperationalStaking.sol
689:     function setValidatorAddress(uint128 validatorId, address newAddress) external whenNotPaused {
690:         Validator storage v = _validators[validatorId];
691:         require(msg.sender == v._address, "Sender is not the validator");
692:         require(v._address != newAddress, "The new address cannot be equal to the current validator address");
693:         require(newAddress != address(0), "Invalid validator address");
694:         require(!v.frozen, "Validator is frozen");
695: 
696:         v.stakings[newAddress].shares += v.stakings[msg.sender].shares;
697:         v.stakings[newAddress].staked += v.stakings[msg.sender].staked;
698:         delete v.stakings[msg.sender];
699: 
700:->       Unstaking[] storage oldUnstakings = v.unstakings[msg.sender];
701:->       uint256 length = oldUnstakings.length;
702:->       require(length <= 300, "Cannot transfer more than 300 unstakings");
703:         Unstaking[] storage newUnstakings = v.unstakings[newAddress];
704:         for (uint128 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
705:->           newUnstakings.push(oldUnstakings[i]);
706:         }
707:         delete v.unstakings[msg.sender];
708: 
709:         v._address = newAddress;
710:         emit ValidatorAddressChanged(validatorId, newAddress);
711:     }
```

L702, check whether `oldUnstakings.length` is greater than 300, if so, tx revert.

L704-706, push all items in the `oldUnstakings` array to the `newUnstakings` array.

In fact, **there is another check missing after for loop**: `newUnstakings.length <= 300`.

As a validator, he is free to call [[unstake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L458)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L458) to adjust his stake amount. As long as `unstake` is called once, [caller's `unstakings` array will push a new unstaking data](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/OperationalStaking.sol#L535), and this data will always exist and will not be popped. Therefore, this array will get longer and longer over time.

## Impact

When the length of the validator's `unstakings` array exceeds 300, the address can no longer be changed.
