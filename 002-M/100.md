# `setValidatorAddress` will not be usable in the long run due to `unstakings` array will eventually reach 300 array length

## Summary

`unstakings` array will increase linearly, and since it's lack of clearing (and popped-out), it will eventually pass the 300 length, resulting `setValidatorAddress` will not be usable

## Vulnerability Detail

When `unstake`, the `unstakings` will increase its length due to push on Line 535. 

On the other hand, when clearing out (setting the unstaking amount to 0), via `recoverUnstaking`, `transferUnstakedOut` or `redelegateUnstaked`, the array is not popped out, only set the `coolDownEnd` to 0
`if (us.amount == 0) us.coolDownEnd = 0;`

This means, the design of `unstakings` will increase linearly, which potentially passed the 300 length size of `unstakings`, thus the `setValidatorAddress` will not usable because it only accept when the unstakings array length is less or equal than 300.

There might be some condition where validator need to change their address, due to this issue, the validator can't change the address.

```js
File: OperationalStaking.sol
455:     /*
456:      * Undelegates some number of tokens from the provided validator
457:      */
458:     function unstake(uint128 validatorId, uint128 amount) external whenNotPaused {
459:         require(amount > 0, "Amount is 0");
460:         _unstake(validatorId, amount);
461:     }
462: 
463:     /*
464:      * Undelegates tokens from the provided validator
465:      */
466:     function _unstake(uint128 validatorId, uint128 amount) internal {
...
529:         // create unstaking instance
530:         uint128 coolDownEnd = uint128(v.disabledAtBlock != 0 ? v.disabledAtBlock : block.number);
531:         unchecked {
532:             coolDownEnd += (isValidator ? validatorCoolDown : delegatorCoolDown);
533:         }
534:         uint128 unstakeId = uint128(v.unstakings[msg.sender].length);
535:         v.unstakings[msg.sender].push(Unstaking(coolDownEnd, effectiveAmount));
536:         emit Unstaked(validatorId, msg.sender, effectiveAmount, unstakeId);
537:     }
...
689:     function setValidatorAddress(uint128 validatorId, address newAddress) external whenNotPaused {
...
700:         Unstaking[] storage oldUnstakings = v.unstakings[msg.sender];
701:         uint256 length = oldUnstakings.length;
702:         require(length <= 300, "Cannot transfer more than 300 unstakings");
...
711:     }
```

## Impact

In the long run, `setValidatorAddress` will not work due to eventually it will reach `unstakings` array length limit of 300

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider to clear out the `unstakings` if the `amount` and `coolDownEnd` are 0s, and switch the last index array data to the `removed` index, and poped the last item
