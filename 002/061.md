# DOS attack will occur because no restriction of unlimited submissions of  block specimen proof causing others to be able submit anymore

## Summary
The code section in question is responsible for checking whether an operator has already submitted for a provided block hash within the same session. The comment in the code mentions that "this should be at most 10 iterations," indicating an expectation for the loop's behavior.

However, the code itself does not explicitly enforce or check the number of iterations against this limit.

```solidity

            }

In the absence of explicit enforcement for the iteration limit, there is a risk of potential resource exhaustion or unexpected behavior in scenarios where the loop iterates excessively. Without a defined constraint, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting numerous specimens, leading to increased gas consumption and potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

An attacker identifies the lack of iteration limit enforcement in the loop responsible for checking operator submissions.
The attacker maliciously submits multiple specimens for a given block hash within the same session submitting an excessive number of specimens for the same block hash within the allowed session period.

Since there is no check for that, it only checks that:[The condition require(block.number <= sessionDeadline, "Session submissions have closed"); aims to ensure that submissions are only allowed within a specified timeframe, preventing submissions after the session deadline](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/218d4a583286fa0d3d4263151a927f6cc9465b62/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L361)

Due to the absence of a [limit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/218d4a583286fa0d3d4263151a927f6cc9465b62/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L372C7-L376C14), the loop iterates excessively, consuming more gas than anticipated.

The increased gas consumption may result in elevated transaction costs, affecting the overall performance of the contract and potentially leading to a DoS attack.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
it is crucial to explicitly enforce the iteration limit within the loop. Implement a check to ensure that the loop does not exceed the specified limit, providing a safeguard against potential abuse.
