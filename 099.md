# In `OperationalStaking.sol` there is no penalisation of Network Operators that are dishonest or malicious this can result in misbehaviour of Network Operators

## Summary
In the [docs](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/covalent-network/staking/), the staking section states that whenever a Network Operator is dishonest or has malicious intent, this Network Operator is penalized by slashing a percentage of their staked amount. But in this contract there is no mechanism or logic like that  

## Vulnerability Detail
This contract does not have any logic that  penalizes network operators who are dishonest or have malicious intent  without interfering with the operation of the protocol as said in the [documentation](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/covalent-network/staking/), 

The only function that exists that penalizes network operators is `freezeValidator` which  interferes with the functionality of the protocol, Imagine a number of operators are frozen at the same time this can interfere  with the functionality of the protocol or even lead to a DoS.

## Impact
* Network operators might misbehave frequently.
* Researchers might be misled from the docs.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The slashing logic must be implemented into the staking contract or the documentation needs to be updated with current penalizing mechanism.
