# Inadequate Access Control - StakingManager Role

## Summary
The contract lacks robust access control for critical functions that can alter the staking mechanism. The use of a single **stakingManager** account for sensitive operations without a multi-signature requirement or additional checks can lead to potential risks if the **stakingManager** account is compromised.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract utilizes a **stakingManager** address for important operations such as **rewardValidators**, **disableValidator**, **enableValidator**, **addValidator**, and **setValidatorAddress**. The current implementation does not enforce multi-signature requirements or other safeguards, making these operations susceptible to unilateral decisions or potential security breaches if the **stakingManager** key is compromised.
## Impact
If the **stakingManager** is compromised or behaves maliciously, it could lead to unauthorized or improper validation management. This might include enabling/disabling validators arbitrarily, misappropriating funds, or manipulating the staking and reward mechanisms, leading to loss of funds or trust in the staking process.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a more robust access control mechanism. This could include multi-signature requirements for critical operations or a role-based access control system (RBAC) to distribute control over sensitive functions across multiple trusted parties. Here's a code snippet illustrating how you might introduce a multi-signature mechanism for critical functions:

```solidity
// Define a structure for managing multi-signature requests
struct MultiSigRequest {
    uint256 id;
    bytes data;
    address[] confirmations;
    bool executed;
}

mapping(uint256 => MultiSigRequest) public multiSigRequests;
uint256 public requestCount;
uint256 public requiredConfirmations;

// Function to propose a new multi-signature request
function proposeRequest(bytes memory data) external onlyOwner {
    uint256 requestId = requestCount++;
    MultiSigRequest storage request = multiSigRequests[requestId];
    request.id = requestId;
    request.data = data;
    request.confirmations.push(msg.sender);
}

// Function to confirm a multi-signature request
function confirmRequest(uint256 requestId) external onlyOwner {
    MultiSigRequest storage request = multiSigRequests[requestId];
    require(!request.executed, "Request already executed");

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < request.confirmations.length; i++) {
        require(request.confirmations[i] != msg.sender, "Already confirmed");
    }
    
    request.confirmations.push(msg.sender);
    if (request.confirmations.length >= requiredConfirmations) {
        executeRequest(requestId);
    }
}

// Function to execute a confirmed multi-signature request
function executeRequest(uint256 requestId) internal {
    MultiSigRequest storage request = multiSigRequests[requestId];
    require(!request.executed, "Request already executed");
    require(request.confirmations.length >= requiredConfirmations, "Insufficient confirmations");

    (bool success, ) = address(this).call(request.data);
    require(success, "Transaction execution failed");

    request.executed = true;
}

// Initialize required confirmations in the constructor or a separate initialization function
constructor() {
    requiredConfirmations = 2; // for example, require signatures from 2 owners
}
```
