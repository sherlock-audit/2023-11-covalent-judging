# Validator unstaking exploit extends delegator cooldown period

## Summary
Validator could misuse unstaking process to delay or indefinitely delay delegators from unstake to receive their funds

## Vulnerability Detail
See _unstake function

```solidity
function _unstake(uint128 validatorId, uint128 amount) internal {
    ...
    if (isValidator && validatorEnableMinStake > 0 && v.disabledAtBlock == 0 && s.staked < validatorEnableMinStake) {
        uint256 disabledAtBlock = block.number;
        v.disabledAtBlock = disabledAtBlock;
        emit ValidatorDisabled(validatorId, disabledAtBlock);
    }

    // create unstaking instance
    uint128 coolDownEnd = uint128(v.disabledAtBlock != 0 ? v.disabledAtBlock : block.number);
    unchecked {
        coolDownEnd += (isValidator ? validatorCoolDown : delegatorCoolDown);
    }
    uint128 unstakeId = uint128(v.unstakings[msg.sender].length);
    v.unstakings[msg.sender].push(Unstaking(coolDownEnd, effectiveAmount));
    emit Unstaked(validatorId, msg.sender, effectiveAmount, unstakeId);
    ...
}
```

Steps for potential exploitation:

A validator begins with a stake slightly above the required minimum.
The validator frequently unstakes small amounts, causing their total stake to fall below the minimum threshold.
When the validator's stake drops below the minimum, the contract automatically disables them and records the current block number in v.disabledAtBlock.
After each disabling, the validator sets up a new unstaking instance. The cooldown end for these instances is determined based on v.disabledAtBlock.
Through repeated actions, the validator can consistently prolong the cooldown period.

## Impact
The "rewardValidators" function rewards validators based on an amount, and this amount should have a correlation with the share. See the following partial code snippet from the rewardValidators function

```solidity
           commissionPaid = uint128((uint256(amount) * uint256(v.commissionRate)) / DIVIDER);

            // distribute the tokens by increasing the exchange rate
            // div by zero impossible due to check above
            // (and in fact, presuming minValidatorEnableStake >= DIVIDER, v.totalShares will
            //  always be >= DIVIDER while validator is enabled)
            v.exchangeRate += uint128((uint256(amount - commissionPaid) * uint256(DIVIDER)) / v.totalShares);

            // commission is not compounded
            // commisison is distributed under the validator instance
            v.commissionAvailableToRedeem += commissionPaid;
```

If a validator can maintain their delegator stake for a longer period, they have the potential to receive more rewards because the total share (or "share" amount) will be larger.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the contract to prevent validators from influencing the timing of delegator unstaking and fund access.
