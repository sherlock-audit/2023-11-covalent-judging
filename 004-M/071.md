# The function `setValidatorAddress` will cause the total amount of the validator's stake to exceed `validatorMaxStake`, thereby violating the protocol.

## Summary

The function `setValidatorAddress` will cause the total amount of the validator's stake to exceed `validatorMaxStake`, thereby violating the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `setValidatorAddress`, the validator can change the address. At the same time, the stake amount of the original validator is accumulated to the new address.

```solidity
v.stakings[newAddress].shares += v.stakings[msg.sender].shares;
v.stakings[newAddress].staked += v.stakings[msg.sender].staked;
```

According to the protocol rules, the total stake amount of the validator cannot exceed `validatorMaxStake`. However, no inspections were carried out here, leading to possible violations of the protocol.

## Impact

The total stake amount of the validator can exceed `validatorMaxStake`.

## Recommendation

Add corresponding checks as shown in function _stake.

```solidity
require(newStaked <= validatorMaxStake, "Validator max stake exceeded");
```
