# setValidatorAddress allows exceeding the validator and delegator staking caps by 27 times

## Summary
By design. validators are not allowed to stake more than `validatorMaxStake`. However, `setValidatorAddress` allows them to bypass that, as it does not check if the new validator address will have more CQT than `validatorMaxStake` (which can happen due to their previous stake as a delegator).

## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine AliceTheValidator wants to stake 5x `validatorMaxStake` (or any amount exceeding `validatorMaxStake`) as a validator, and/or she wants to attract more delegated CQT than `validatorMaxStake * maxCapMultiplier`. Doing it via `stake` directly will result in "Validator max stake exceeded" error (as it should), so she needs a workaround.

So she `stakes` 5x `validatorMaxStake` as a delegator from another address (`alice2`), and then from `alice1` calls `setValidatorAddress(newAddress = alice2)` . Now, `alice2` is staking 6x `validatorMaxStake` as a validator. Moreover, her delegator staking limit is also increased by the same multiplier.

## Impact
Validator and delegator staking caps exceed the intended values by up to `maxCapMultiplier` times (27x at launch).

```diff
        v.stakings[newAddress].shares += v.stakings[msg.sender].shares;
        v.stakings[newAddress].staked += v.stakings[msg.sender].staked;
+       require(v.stakings[newAddress].staked <= validatorMaxStake);
