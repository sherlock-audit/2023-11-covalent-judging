# BlockSpecimenProofChain::submitBlockSpecimenProof Block specimen producers may submit the same specimen multiple times and force quorum

## Summary
Block specimen producers are incentivized to submit valid data representing blocks to the `BlockSpecimenProofChain` contract. However there is no check to ensure that a producer sends data only once, thus a malicious producer may send the same invalid block multiple times, forcing the contract to accept it as valid.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the implementation of `submitBlockSpecimenProof`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-covalent/blob/main/cqt-staking/contracts/BlockSpecimenProofChain.sol#L328-L392

There is no check to ensure that it is called only once per session by a `BlockSpecimenProducer`.
Also since the role `BlockSpecimenProducer` is not actually a privileged role and is accessible by staking CQT as can be seen on this doc page:
https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/covalent-network/operator-onboarding-bsp/

We can assume that it can operate maliciously under certain conditions (for example if it is possible to extract profit from producing a false block specimen).

## Impact
A malicious block specimen producer can force the contract to accept a wrong block for a given block height

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure that the function cannot be called multiple times for a given chain and block height by a validator:

```diff
+   require(!submitted[chainId][blockHeight][validatorId], 'Producer already submitted block specimen');
+   submitted[chainId][blockHeight][validatorId] = true;
```
