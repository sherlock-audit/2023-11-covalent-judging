# If user unstakes before claiming rewards, rewards are permanently lost

## Summary
A delegator can unstake everything, making their `s.shares` go to 0. Once their `s.shares` are at 0 for that validator, then `_redeemRewards()` will calculate their rewards to be 0 because the `totalValue` is 0 because their `s.shares` is 0, because they are no longer staking anything.

The flaw is that `_redeemRewards()` rewards can be lost even if the user had rewards to claim, but then unstaked before they claimed their rewards. This is because it bases the users rewards off of the users current number of shares that are staked.

## Vulnerability Detail
See summary

## Impact
If user forgets to claim rewards before they unstake, they can no longer claim those rewards and the rewards are lost. Even if unstaking also bundles rewards into the unstaking process, then the rewards are delayed by 28 days instead of instantly being able to claim the rewards as they should. (this doesn't appear to be the case though).

## Recommendation
Cache calculated rewards somewhere, or don't allow unstakes if they have non-zero rewards that could be claimed.
