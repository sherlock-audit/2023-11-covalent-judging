# Inadequate Access Control in finalizeSpecimenSession Function (Risk of Unauthorized Session Finalization)

## Summary
The **finalizeSpecimenSession** function is responsible for finalizing a specimen session but does not have proper access controls. This allows any user, not just authorized operators or administrators, to finalize a session, potentially leading to unauthorized or premature finalization.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function **finalizeSpecimenSession** lacks access control mechanisms, meaning any external entity can call it without restriction. This absence of validation on who can finalize a session can lead to unauthorized finalization, disrupting the intended workflow and potentially compromising the integrity of the session data.
## Impact
Unauthorized finalization of sessions could disrupt the normal operation of the contract, lead to data corruption, or allow malicious actors to manipulate session outcomes for their benefit.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement proper access control in the **finalizeSpecimenSession** function to ensure that only authorized entities can finalize a session. This could be achieved by requiring that the caller has a specific role or permission. You might consider using role-based access control (RBAC) provided by **OpenZeppelin**, as follows:

```solidity
function finalizeSpecimenSession(uint64 chainId, uint64 blockHeight) public onlyAuthorized {
    // existing logic
}

// Modifier to restrict access
modifier onlyAuthorized() {
    require(hasRole(SOME_ROLE, msg.sender), "Caller is not authorized");
    _;
}
```
In the above code snippet, **onlyAuthorized** is a modifier that checks whether the caller has a specific role (**SOME_ROLE**), and the role is managed by an access control contract or mechanism. Replace **SOME_ROLE** with the actual role that should have the permission to finalize sessions. You can manage roles using OpenZeppelin's **AccessControl** or a similar mechanism based on your system's design.
